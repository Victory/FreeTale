HUMMINGBIRD
===========

Site tracking and analytics storage


Description
---------------

Hummingbird serves a 1x1 tracking pixel to users.  In the browser's GET request it
sends back tracking data generated by javascript.


Requirements
-------------------

 * node.js v0.8.0 or higher

Installation
--------------

    git clone git://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird.git
    cd hummingbird

    # Use npm to install the dependencies
    npm install

    # To use the map, download MaxMind's GeoIP database and extract to the root directory:
    wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
    gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz


Running Hummingbird
------------------------------

To start the analytics server, run the following:

    node server.js

By default a dashboard will be run on port 8080.  You can disable it for production use in
config/config.js.  The dashboard is just html served out of public/; you can serve it using
any webserver.


Deployment
----------

Make sure to properly secure the dashboard if you don't want outside people to see it. This
typically means putting the dashboard behind nginx or apache using basic auth. The dashboard's
'listen' function takes a second argument that is the interface to bind; typically you
would choose "127.0.0.1" to only allow access from localhost, or "0.0.0.0" to listen on all
interfaces.  You should then run the tracking pixel on a different port so that it is accessible
to the outside world.


Setting Up Tracking
-------------------

The file `client/hummingbird.js` contains a small script to trigger a hummingbird event.  You
can either paste the contents of the file into the body of your webpage or you can upload it
to your server as a .js file and reference it with a `<script>` tag.  Once you have done so,
in the footer of your page you can call

    HummingbirdTracker.track();

Called with no arguments, it will send over some standard parameters such as the page URL.  You
can also pass arbitrary data with the event:

    HummingbirdTracker.track({logged_in: true});

The data can be used within Hummingbird's metrics to filter events on the backend.


Architecture Overview
---------------------

Hummingbird is organized into two parts: a node.js-based tracking server that records user
activity via a tracking pixel, and a collection of javascript-based widgets that display that
activity.  The server broadcasts all activity to the clients using Websockets if possible, and
falls back to Flash sockets or long polling if necessary.

The Hummingbird.WebSocket object receives websocket events from the server in the form of JSON
objects.  Individual widgets subscribe to a metric and register handler functions to be called
whenever that metric is present.


Logging Customization
---------------------

Metrics are stored in lib/metrics and auto-loaded. Each metric contains a handler function that is
called every time a new user event occurs.  Metrics store data in the `data` object property which
gets emitted to clients in intervals specified by the metric. A basic example can be found in
lib/metrics/total_views.js. An example of how a metric can filter based on query params is in
lib/metric/cart_adds.js.


Display Customization
---------------------

Hummingbird comes with some stock widgets (Counter, Logger, Graph) that demonstrate how to hook into
the data provided by the node.js server.  For the minimum amount required to create a widget, see
public/js/widgets/logger.js.  A widget is an object whose prototype extends Hummingbird.Base and
implements onMessage.


Tips
-----

 * To run the UI locally but stream data from your production server, use the url http://localhost:8080/?ws_server=your-host.com&ws_port=12345
